# Pomfret-landscape
I am hoping to create a 3d design of the Pomfret School campus from a birds eye view
I saw it as a 3d design created in a vector graphic map of the Grand Canyon, and am now trying to create it myself but instead for Pomfret School, and then possibly getting the app to apply the same idea to any address in the world
